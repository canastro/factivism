  book introduced me to the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic">
    "availability heuristic"
  </a>
  and how we're biased to negativity due to the fact that most news follow a
  policy of
  <i>"if it bleeds, it leads"</i>
  .
</p>
<blockquote>
  The availability heuristic, also known as availability bias, is a mental
  shortcut that relies on immediate examples that come to a given person's mind
  when evaluating a specific topic, concept, method or decision. The
  availability heuristic operates on the notion that if something can be
  recalled, it must be important, or at least more important than alternative
  solutions which are not as readily recalled. Subsequently, under the
  availability heuristic, people tend to heavily weigh their judgments toward
  more recent information, making new opinions biased toward that latest news.

  We're everyday bombarded with negative news and often forgot how far humanity
  has come. Serves this site to randomly present you a chart that shows how
  we're progressing in multiple fronts, and that things are not as bad as we
  perceive it.

  Kudos to
  <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/">"Our World in Data"</a>
  for all the charts.
